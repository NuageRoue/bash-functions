# bash-functions

a collection of aliases, functions and variables that I find useful when using WSL 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bash-functions.git
   cd bash-functions
   ```

launch the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh 
```

This will automatically copy the folder to a selected directory (which can be changed by editing the setup file) and source the necessary files in your .bashrc.

Commands that depend on a package won't be set up if the package is not detected.
